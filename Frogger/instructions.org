* Create the frog

** Step 1
   Open the frog.js file in the project folder. Access the project folder by clicking the arrow underneath the play button.

** Step 2
   Write a Constructor called `Frog()` to _frog.js_. It should take the x position, y position and size of the frog as input parameters.

** Step 3
   Add the following properties to the class:
- x position
- y positionHints
- size

** Step 4
   Create a member function called `draw()` for the frog that will draw a frog at its current position.

** Step 5
   Go back into the _sketch.js_ file and create a variable that will hold the size of the frog called `tile_size`. This variable will also be used
   to create the road, the cars, the logs and the river, as they all have to correspond to that size.

** Step 6
   Now create the frog object and initalize it using the Constructor you wrote.

*** Hint
    Creating an object
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      var object=ObjectConstructor(arg1, arg2, ...);    
    #+END_SRC

** Step 7
   Call your the frog's draw function in the main draw function and the frog should then be displayed on the screen.

* Make the frog move

** Step 1
   We want to make the frog jump around, so for that, we are going to create four functions that will make the frog jump in the four different directions.

** Step 2
   Go back into your _frog.js_ file and add a function called `moveUp()`, which will move the frog according to it's size.

** Step 3
   Now repeat that for the three other directions.

** Step 4
   Go back into your sketch.js file and create a function called keyPressed(). This function will be called once a key is pressed.
   You can then check which key has been pressed by using the keyCode variable, that contains the current key being pressed.

*** Hint
    Use if statements to check if the desired key has been pressed

    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      function keyPressed()
      {
          if(/*condition*/)
          {
              // move frog in the direction
          }
      } 
    #+END_SRC

* Create the road and cars
