* Create the frog  
** Instruction
   
   Using everything you have learned until now, we are going to make a game similar to 
   Crossy Road. The first step is to create a Frog that the player will control to
   cross a road and a river.
   
** Step 1
   Open the frog.js file in the project folder. Access the project folder by clicking the 
   arrow underneath the play button.
   
** Step 2
   Write a Constructor called `Frog` to _frog.js_. It should take the x position, y position 
   and size of the frog as input parameters.
   
*** Hint
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      function Constructor(Param1, Param2, ...)
      {
          // code
      }
    #+END_SRC
    
** Step 3
   Add the following properties to the class:
- x position
- y positionHints
- size
  
*** Hint
    Use the `this` keyword
    
** Step 4
   Create a member function called `draw` for the frog that will draw a frog at
   its current position.
   zz
** Step 5
   Go back into the _sketch.js_ file and create a variable that will hold the size of 
   the frog called `tile_size`. This variable will also be used
   to create the road, the cars, the logs and the river, as they all have 
   to correspond to that size.
   
** Step 6
   Now create the frog object and initalize it using the Constructor you wrote.
   
*** Hint
    Creating an object
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      var object=ObjectConstructor(arg1, arg2, ...);
    #+END_SRC
    
** Step 7
   Call your the frog's draw function in the main draw function and the frog should 
   then be displayed on the screen.
   
* Make the frog move
  
** Step 1
   We want to make the frog jump around, so for that, we are going to create four 
   functions that will make the frog jump in the four different directions.
   
** Step 2
   Go back into your _frog.js_ file and add a function called `moveUp`, which 
   will move the frog according to it's size.
   
** Step 3
   Now repeat that for the three other directions.
   
** Step 4
   Go back into your _sketch.js_ file and create a function called `keyPressed()`. 
   This function will be called once a key is pressed. You can then check which key has 
   been pressed by using the `keyCode` variable, that contains the current key being pressed.
   
*** Hint
    Use if statements to check if the desired key has been pressed.
    
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      function keyPressed()
      {
          if(/*condition*/)
          {
              // move frog in the direction
          }
      } 
    #+END_SRC
    
** Step 5
   You should now be able to move the frog around on the screen.
* Create the road and cars
  
** Step 1
   The first step is to draw the road. For that just draw the rectangle at the desired position.
   The lane size should be equal to the size of the frog.
   
** Step 2
   Now open the _car.js_ file and create a Constructor for a car that will take the x 
   position, y position, width, height and speed as parameters.
   
** Step 3
   Create member variables for these input parameters.
   
** Step 4
   We now need a `move` and a `draw` member function for the car to update its position 
   and draw it to the screen.
   
** Step 5
   The move function should make the car move using it's speed and wrap around when it 
   reaches the side of the screen.
   
** Step 6: Think
   How would you make the cars wrap around the screen even though they could be going in 
   two directions.
   
*** Hint
    Use an if statement to determine the direction.
    
    
** Step 7
   Check if the Car constructor works by creating an object and drawing it in the draw function.
   
* Add multiple cars in lanes
  
** Step 1
   Create an array called `road` that will hold all the cars in the different lanes.
   
*** Hint
    An array can be created using the following syntax
    
    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      function setup()
      {
          var array=[];
          array.push("Hello");
      }
    #+END_SRC
    
** Step 2
   You can use a `for` loop to `push` the cars to the array, by changing the y value of 
   the cars. You can also change the x value of cars in the same lane to have multiple cars 
   in that lane.
   
** Step 3
   Now use the `road` array to draw all the cars to the screen in the draw function. 
   You can use a for loop for this.
   
** Step 4
   You should now be able to see the cars. Now add code to make the cars move using the 
   speed you gave them.
   
** Step 5 Think
   How would you add different colours to the cars?
   
* Collision detection
  
** Step 1
   In your frog constructor, add a member function called `intersect` that will take an object, 
   like a car, as a parameter.
   
** Step 2
   Use this function to check if the center of the frog intersects with any part of the object.
   
*** Hint
    Use the object's x, y, width and height to determine if the it intersects.
    
** Step 3
   If it is intersecting, make the function return `true`, otherwise the function should
   return `false`.
* Add a river with logs
